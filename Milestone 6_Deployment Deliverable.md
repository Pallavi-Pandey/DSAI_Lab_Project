### **Deployment Deliverable:**

* **Google Colab or Kaggle Demo Notebook** (fallback for GPU-heavy Whisper + Llama pipeline)
* **Local Demo + REST API** (Flask/FastAPI)

---

# **1. Clear Instructions to Run**

## **Option A — Run on Google Colab / Kaggle (Recommended for GPU models)**

1. Open the notebook:

   ```
   notebooks/deployment/colab_demo.ipynb
   ```
2. Set runtime to **GPU**
   *Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4/P100/V100)*
3. Run all cells to:

   * Install dependencies
   * Load Whisper for ASR
   * Load Text Processing Pipeline (Milestone 4 + 5)
   * Load Llama 3.2 for final generation
4. Provide input (audio/text)
5. Select role (doctor/patient)
6. View final output
